        To Dad,
        <br>
        <br>
        Happy birthday! I can't give you a physical card this year, so I thought I'd do something more virtual.
        Please don't analyze it too much, coding is a pain in the ass and I am not very good at it. I don't 
        know how you've done it for so long. These days, I've been thinking about how long you worked at
        Microsoft. It was a really long time, much longer than I remember it feeling. It must've been hard to
        stay. I don't think I could've done it, but you've always been very selfless when it comes to taking care
        of the family. You have done so much for us and I know that every good thing that I earn in the future
        will, in some part, be thanks to you, whether it be because of the things that you taught me or because of the way that you
        have provided for us all these years. While I'm sure that you'll keep doing it (and I'll forever be thankful for it),
        I hope that you are able to take time for yourself. It would make me happy to see you doing things just because they 
        make <i>you</i> happy. It took us such a long time to learn what kind of cake flavor you prefer and I don't want 
        the rest of your life to be us learning details about you that we should've known sooner. Some of my happiest, most peaceful memories are of us going on late night drives, buying french 
        fries and listening to music while we laugh at dumb things. It's important to me that you know that. I love that
        we are able to get along so well and I hope we'll always be this close. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I love you! 사랑해요!! 생일축하합니다!!!
